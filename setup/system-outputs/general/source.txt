his heart was in tatters , and it 's all there in the report . _eos i only mean that you can 't be sure what specifically brought on the attack . _eos how many angels can dance on the head of a pin ? _eos which artery gave out , which clot formed when , it 's hard to say .
there 's evidence that judge schakowsky is busy . _eos perhaps even brusque . _eos but not that he exceeded his authority . _eos in which case , his immunity should remain intact .
bruce is serving a greater purpose . _eos we found another owl . _eos we think this map indicates the secret hideouts of the court . _eos james gordon .
so then you don 't think the attack at nighthorse 's house was a mob hit . _eos just doesn 't fit their style . _eos plus , nighthorse said he never had a deal with the mob . _eos even though the mob swears they did .
i 'll go find him . _eos once we get that out of you ... separate ways . _eos hey . _eos i think she made it .

and don 't even think about lying because i will smack the living ... _eos - diamond ! _eos - sisters can smack sisters . _eos not in a police precinct they can 't .

i 'm sure they are considering all possibilities . _eos well , are they ? _eos my father 's dead ! _eos i want to know what happened !
you should know , i 've advised my client not to answer any questions . _eos that 's okay , he can just listen . _eos we know you lied to us the other day , mr. lerner . _eos when we said there was evidence that suggested your brother-in-law was a sex predator , you couldn 't get on board fast enough .
pins and needles over here , brother . _eos what did you do ? _eos i got a can of gasoline . _eos i was convinced that the only solution was to burn your actual body .

i think duval is an honest-to-god good person . _eos i think that 's probably something he got from his mother . _eos i think with lives on the line , my son will ruin his career . _eos when he 's gone to jail , he could tell the fbi about me and the bridge , about the car tracing back to lookinglass .

- no ! _eos - it 's okay . _eos it 'll only help . _eos it 's okay .
but nobody 's answering , and we can 't get inside . _eos hey , capp , why don 't you check the back there and see if there 's another way in ? _eos copy that . _eos cruz , see if you can peek inside .
what else is there ? _eos oh , you 're not thinking of using danny , are you ? _eos exploiting his corporate crusader image ? _eos exposing the board for wanting to oust us because we wanted to stop poisoning people ?
i don 't know . _eos they do take everything into account : _eos his psychiatric evaluation , his behavior in prison , your victim statement _eos so , you think that could sway the board ?
i didn 't want to force him and make things worse . _eos i think he wants to speak with you . _eos hey , ethan . _eos can i come in ?

i 'll see you in the quinjet . _eos here . _eos remember your training . _eos but we 're just going to have a chat with a scientist .

but my rule is three strikes and you 're out . _eos otherwise , where does it end ? _eos in that case , why not do this publicly ? _eos i don 't need to do this publicly , stephanie .
but if i try to remove any of the individual pieces , the mechanism i designed will deadlock the door . _eos you have to believe me . _eos if you try to blow it open with gunpowder , you 'll bring down the roof . _eos drilling at it might take a week .
we play mahjong . _eos i suppose those japs made you give up everything when they came marching in . _eos between that and their delusional sense of superiority . _eos how did you stomach it ?

i mean , you don 't just teach them what to do with their hands . _eos you teach them what to do with this , how to live through this . _eos i mean , you take it on yourself . _eos i know .
i 'm so sorry . _eos i 've enjoyed every moment we 've spent together . _eos more than i thought i could . _eos but it 's impossible .
the way you two feel about each other ? _eos that 's real . _eos are we done ? _eos i don 't think there 's any internal bleeding .
