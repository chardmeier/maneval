it 's probably busted , knowing you . _eos i 'll say this about you , matt murdock . _eos you are a lot of bad things . _eos boring is not one of them .

you 'll find something and we 're okay for now . _eos you 're gonna make up my salary with your new essay writing business ? _eos if i need to , yes . _eos i thought i 'd talk to your dad , actually .

okay , even if you 're right , which , i 'm still not saying , how are we going to prove it ? _eos the bank transfers are untraceable , and lisa 's had carte blanche to that computer for at least two days . _eos i mean , she would have been smart enough to get rid of any digital track she might have left . _eos okay , now , you might not need sleep , but i do , so please , get out of my room .

i boosted the premium stuff , otto . _eos you 're welcome . _eos hello , selina . _eos what the hell are you doing here ?

i think you don 't do all this stuff for the earth . _eos i think you do it for you because you don 't actually care about anyone else 's ideas . _eos you only care about your own ideas and hearing yourself talk . _eos so , pardon me , jeremy .

you 're not getting that code . _eos you 're never getting into patterson 's system . _eos because you 're never getting out of this room . _eos you 're trapped and you know it .
suits you . _eos you have 12 hours before you need to be back in the tank . _eos set the timer on the phone for you . _eos maybe you dig this cops-and-robbers stuff .

would you want your son to be anything but what he is ? _eos i want him to be happy . _eos but what if he 's not ? _eos would you want him to pretend ?
really ? _eos by slaughtering murderers and leaving souvenirs and notes at the crime scene ? _eos that 's how you 're dealing with it ? _eos what about you , alicia ?
at first i thought he was running a short con , and then i thought he was doing that as a distraction so he could lift my watch . _eos now i see he was just wanting to make sure you and me got some alone time . _eos that what you wanted ? _eos i want the 150k you stole from our safe .
so you want me to go on television and shame another girl just to get the focus off of myself ? _eos this is what 's wrong with america , women constantly hurting other women . _eos got it , hillary , no problem . _eos i was just trying to tell you that all of that cameras would be focused on you , every eye in america .

do you need something ? _eos yes , if you have a minute . _eos i do if it 's important . _eos i just wanted to talk to you about my assignment .
then when we found the body again , it was missing . _eos ian took it from your bedroom this morning . _eos the only way that you could have had it was if you saw alexander after the funeral . _eos put the matches away .
but now , it will seem suspicious if we are not seen to be still searching for mather . _eos so you must go rejoin the hunt and pretend to search and wait some time before coming back . _eos and by then i will have cotton all ready ! _eos come here .
because , tomorrow morning , you are on a one-way flight to shanghai , where we 'll be joining you in a month . _eos not if there 's a new con . _eos alice vaughan and her entire team know this face . _eos you 're burnt .
well , i imagine that 's because he wanted leann on the russian plan . _eos then why did she come to him instead of him coming to her ? _eos look , i 'm not gonna get into the weeds on this , but let 's just cut to the chase . _eos the allegations that you 're making are just as ludicrous as they were the first time we met .
did you consider taking him on as an associate ? _eos we did . _eos briefly . _eos sounds like you didn 't hire him .
what do you want with me , gillies ? _eos well , i need your ... help with something i 'm having a little trouble with . _eos - help with what ? _eos - i want you to kill me .
you 're not dictating the terms here . _eos i am . _eos it 's bitcoin , or i swear to god i hit send . _eos go ahead , hit send .

let go of me ! _eos grab him ! _eos what about you , huh ? _eos do you know where jerome is ?
you are home . _eos follow me . _eos time to go . _eos you 're not gonna want to see this .
you didn 't tell me that . _eos look , i 'm at the end of a rope i should 've fallen off of a long time ago . _eos and i need to help someone . _eos it 's a long shot , but you 're strong , that 's why i chose you .
are you attracted to him ? _eos i don 't think so . _eos i mean , the kiss was enjoyable , but i think he was wearing more lip gloss than i was . _eos then there you go .
doesn 't that bother you ? _eos i don 't hear it anymore . _eos now , saul ... _eos tell me about mira .
okay , look . _eos it is ridiculous and illegal for your husband to treat you like this . _eos now we 're talking . _eos you 're his wife , for god 's sake .
i was wondering if we could ask you just one last favour . _eos it would be a pleasure . _eos but wedding plans will have to wait . _eos what you need is a good long rest , and i 'll come by this evening with some dinner .
you know him . _eos no . _eos he 's unrecognizable . _eos look closer , here .
well , they 're gonna want to do a cake here at one pp . _eos how 's , um , late friday , say 5 : 00 ? _eos who wants cake at 5 : 00 ? _eos let 's not do this again .
which is why i was like , " we need to go to him . " _eos charles , where are you ? _eos i 've got him cornered in some bushes , but i don 't know where i am , and my ... _eos wait , stop talking .
i hope you can bear it . _eos don 't worry , i 'm my mother 's daughter . _eos dying is easy , but i 'd like to live . _eos did i tell you about the young man who did my papers ?
they said you were having some kind of breakdown . _eos i told them about my son , of course . _eos the golden boy with the brain damage from the football injury . _eos they 're worried about you .
it 's none of my business . _eos three more weeks . _eos that 's all you have left until those doors fly open and we send you out into the real world . _eos now , you 've made your requests for where you want to work .
you wanted to suspend him because of his colored nails . _eos i said that the boy 's nail polish caused a disruption in class . _eos his classmates started cackling ... _eos then you should suspend the others , not him .
i know you 're obnoxious and stubborn ... _eos i hope you 're going somewhere with this . _eos but you 're also loyal and honest and a big old softie when you stop worrying about what people are thinking about you . _eos one day , somebody 's gonna love you , heart and soul .
they obviously know a lot about you and sam . _eos they 'll be expecting you . _eos i 'm the last person they 'd expect . _eos you were good at this , weren 't you ?
so you have dragged me into a war between hiram and clifford , that 's great . _eos i know you 're angry . _eos and i know that i have no right to ask this ... _eos but please stay on this project .
was not expecting them to help you find the van so quickly . _eos actually , the sales records were a bust . _eos paperwork might be filed , but it hasn 't been put in the system yet . _eos so how did you come to invite us here ?
i swear to god , i 've changed . _eos well , you didn 't change enough . _eos get up . _eos we 're booking you for murder .
i knew you were up to something . _eos what are you really doing down here ? _eos you 're researching chromosomes . _eos you know how to read that ?
i love andrew and i want you to stop communicating with him . _eos i imagine there are plenty of people on your staff qualified to handle any business regarding the hack . _eos i 'm gonna marry him , avery . _eos please don 't get in the way .
did you know she sang as she burned ? _eos no . _eos none of us are heroes . _eos i suppose not .
- jeff 's a good influence on you . _eos - you think ? _eos i mean , he got you to go to a party . _eos you 've done that before .
it 's not how it happened . _eos i just gave you a great opening to lie one more time and you didn 't take it . _eos look , there is no way that i can possibly explain this to you . _eos then try by telling me how you 'd explain it to yourself .
you called out a serial killer on television . _eos you played games with his head . _eos so i 'm responsible for him murdering 22 innocent women ? _eos i 'm not saying it was your fault .
ben . _eos i didn 't know he was gonna do that . _eos laurel , you don 't owe me anything . _eos we 're on opposite sides of the aisle , you and i.
got him . _eos ( horns honking ) _eos hey , come on ! _eos come on , come on , come on !
you can go after him . _eos but you won 't find him . _eos and one night soon you 'll wake and he 'll be standing over your bed . _eos and his face will be the last thing you see before you die .
i thought you were one of those . _eos getting involved too deeply with any woman will only weaken your resolve . _eos so you 're saying i can 't be with clary ? _eos i 'm saying it wasn 't what i expected of you .
did you know that in mexico , the cartels run the prisons , use them as power bases , information centers , factories for training soldiers and sicarios ? _eos i wanted the world to see that , for them to understand what 's going on in there . _eos only one way to do that . _eos did you get yourself arrested ?
no , you can 't go in there . _eos what did he say ? _eos nothing useful . _eos you 're just gonna leave him in there ?
take that away as well . _eos the food attracts flies and i prefer my solitude . _eos the pepper came from the garden . _eos the garden grows strong even in your absence .
we spoke to your boss . _eos we know it was you driving that taxi . _eos that 's your cab right there . _eos you trying to tell us that 's not you ?
and who did you talk to at the party ? _eos everyone . _eos oh , we 'll need names , please , trish . _eos anyone you can remember , including the women .
they used you . _eos think i wanna spend my last days in court , testifying against my family ? _eos you walked away from them for a reason . _eos you said you didn 't want to die an o 'malley .
you defended him . _eos you think his outfit was racist ? _eos of course . _eos how would you feel if someone showed up at a party wearing a sombrero and pushing a lawnmower and said they were latino ?
you buried a body . _eos prove it . _eos i just might . _eos but until then , you 're free to go .
just a few more therapy sessions and you 'll be right as rain . _eos more therapy ? _eos oh , just a little . _eos i know there 's a discomfort factor , but after all , it is making you better .
i think you 're being a little tough on your son . _eos excuse me ? _eos well , it 's obvious why he didn 't tell you right away . _eos i mean , look at the way you 're reacting .
may i speak to you privately for a second ? _eos we 'll talk later . _eos yes . _eos how could you do this without telling anyone ?
excuse me ? _eos you 're looking for anything to bring them down . _eos any speck of impropriety . _eos because this entire operation is all about your brother .
and i think that yours was to help me through this . _eos thank you . _eos it 's my job . _eos no , your job is to cut people up and take out their disease .
you can stop it now . _eos still remember ? _eos i was bitten by a dog once . _eos you 're the one who chased that dog using a peeble .
all you have to do is retrieve it . _eos now , as for my compensation , i think that- - _eos unidac industries . _eos yes , i will make sure you get the , um , information you desire .
you may have left evidence inside . _eos far safer for you to insert yourself directly into the investigation , possibly control it . _eos if it were my intention to deflect suspicion , why would i point out that the killer was likely a woman ? _eos you would have anticipated that i would come to the same conclusion .
what 's wrong with you ? _eos what are you doing ? _eos are you crazy ? _eos get off of there !
tell me about the security system . _eos the evidence officer we spoke to said they recently upgraded the facility . _eos beside the keypad they put in a new climate-control system and additional security cameras . _eos get the footage from the last week .
who the fuck do you think you 're talking to ? _eos do you know who i am ? _eos you 're a nobody , old man . _eos you 'll return the plans , and i 'll find someone more obedient .
since i no longer need it . _eos for xiomara . _eos you know ... you found a good woman . _eos i think you should marry her .
it knows that it 's fond of you . _eos but your credentials were unverifiable . _eos financial holdings , royal ballet , none of it ! _eos you had me investigated ?
david , do you really believe that ? _eos or is this just because this is the day that your liver is going to be ablated ? _eos ♪ ♪ _eos i saw your name on the board in ir .
but you can 't possibly think that this is the right thing to do . _eos so , what , you 'd rather i just stay here and wait for something bad to happen again ? _eos because i 'm not gonna let it . _eos ruth , none of this is your fault .
he says it 's you killing debbie . _eos he was listening to me . _eos he never listens to me . _eos so you said that you killed debbie ?
well , louis , i 'm not going to do that because whoever we replace them with , this conversation is just going to happen again . _eos because we both know that you 're out of your mind . _eos it 's not gonna happen again because in this particular case , i am not out of my mind . _eos why do you want me to do this ?
no . _eos no ! _eos move over , rope . _eos hold on !
you 're right . _eos you 're not guilty of your father 's crimes . _eos and i 'm not beholden to my ancestor 's vows . _eos then why are you here ?
why you 'd go to the trouble of bugging him if he was so damn peripheral . _eos we 're not having this conversation . _eos oh , yeah , we are . _eos somehow you people knew about this murder , and you sat on it .
why would i pay a movie star 's taxes ? _eos to get him to lead you to your brother . _eos that way you could kill el oso and take over the family business , much in the same way you took over the family bed . _eos and when zane couldn 't get a second meeting with el oso , he was a loose end , so you killed him .
you 've never heard of it ? _eos no . _eos why ? _eos relic holdings was incorporated last year , in delaware , under your name .
before we start , he wanted me to read you guys something . _eos now , keep in mind these are his words , not mine . _eos he 's a touch melodramatic . _eos " what i 'm about to tell you is top secret .
well , you wouldn 't happen to know a donna monaghan ? _eos she works out that way . _eos no . _eos well , she 's not the psychiatrist you 've been seeing the last two years ?
that 's , uh , that 's not him jumping over the hedge over there ? _eos it 's him , right ? _eos have a seat . _eos okay , why don 't you tell us , uh , why don 't you tell us about this woman that you killed ?
you know , even if i took you back , which i won 't , how 's it gonna work now ? _eos how are we gonna see trish , or ian or ... half this town , now that everybody knows ? _eos we can style it out . _eos you actually think that 's possible , don 't you ?
you don 't care to know how he betrayed me ? _eos i care more about your need to tell me . _eos but truthfully , i 'm not curious . _eos isn 't that part of your job ?
listen to me . _eos compared to this , what mike ross did barely constitutes spitting on a sidewalk . _eos i know that . _eos then what the hell is wrong with you ?
who do you have ? _eos really ? _eos that ? _eos and you want to double it ?
you want to give it a go ? _eos do some therapy ? _eos okay . _eos yeah , let 's do this .
well , you might as well tell me , if you 're gonna kill me . _eos i suggest you die remembering him as he was . _eos it 's better that way . _eos unless you 'd care to join him .
just look at those rags . _eos you can 't wear those to a party . _eos here . _eos find yourselves something fun to wear and join the party , okay ?
but it wasn 't a trick , was it ? _eos watch yourself . _eos you just accused me of treason . _eos also accusing you of ordering your man huxley to commit at least six murders .
and you 're not gonna leave my side until i 'm convinced that you 're ok . _eos i 'm 100 % ok . _eos good . _eos then you can prove it to me while i drive you around the new mystic falls .
i fly out on the red-eye tonight . _eos okay , well , then i 'll convince you . _eos you are very relentless . _eos you have no idea .
but you are losing , francis . _eos people are getting killed at the gas pumps . _eos america works is falling flat . _eos your campaign manager is ten years behind ten years ago .
i 'm sympathetic to your desire to identify a suspect who isn 't your father , but ... _eos what 's this ? _eos i have no idea . _eos but i was asked to give it to you .
really , mary , pull yourself together . _eos how could you be so cruel ? _eos i just found out that my child is dead . _eos i left him in your care .
on the bright side , at least i get to kill you . _eos no , you can 't ! _eos that 's the trouble with one hostage . _eos you kill me , the only reason he 'll come back is for revenge .
it 's not my call . _eos martin " _eos no one else can arrange this meeting other than you .. _eos do it ..
wear it around your neck at all times . _eos had a badge before . _eos not like this one . _eos don 't lose it .
only one of us is gonna make it out of this alive . _eos i am avtoritet . _eos there 's no way you 're going to suffer for my sins , oliver . _eos that 's why i 'm not giving you a choice .

you know you can tell him anything , and he can 't repeat it , right ? _eos you 're not going to jail . _eos i guarantee that . _eos you hear me ?
it appears you 've had quite the harrowing experience . _eos jocelyn tells me you were abducted by dorothea rollins , a warlock under valentine 's control . _eos uh , that 's right . _eos did she portal you to a tanker ship in the east river ?
- you don 't want that . _eos - you don 't know what i want . _eos sylvie . _eos what have you done to her ?

i 'm glad you asked . _eos the main problem is pressure . _eos there isn 't any . _eos so , don 't hold your breath or your lungs will explode .
they 're concerned about what you said last night . _eos i told them that it was just part of the show , that you 're fine . _eos let her tell us that . _eos melanie , can we ask you a few questions ?
you gotta be kiddin ' me . _eos what ? _eos can smell the booze on you from here . _eos you got a lot of balls coming back in here , fusco .

your fish died . _eos yes , i know . _eos you 're a terrible person . _eos you hurt that little girl .

i am dying . _eos i have written her this letter . _eos you are with fbi , no ? _eos you can find her .

well , what about allison 's admirers ? _eos what are you talking about ? _eos well , i 'm wondering if she had any clients that spent an inordinate amount of time with her- - or coworkers for that matter . _eos i mean , you knew her best , right ?
i-i assume there 's a reason that he went all frat boy on you . _eos i said something stupid . _eos grief makes people do stupid things . _eos how are you ?
and that 's before the 10-ball you just saved me . _eos it 's not a fluke . _eos it 's efficiency . _eos it 's you .
i know about you and paul . _eos and i know that percy found out . _eos but that didn 't stop you . _eos which is why you took a perfectly healthy goldfish to the vet 's .
before you hear this from someone else , you know i said i was at home all night ? _eos where were you ? _eos in the spinney at the bottom of clutterbuck 's farm . _eos let me guess .
you thought he was still alive . _eos after all , you knew that the funeral was a sham . _eos what are you accusing me of ? _eos falling in love .
go ahead . _eos impressive . _eos no , you 're peeking ! _eos you 're totally peeking .

parked a little close . _eos hey . _eos you look ... _eos okay , don 't mind me .

you passed the test . _eos this was all a loyalty test ? _eos it was the only way to know . _eos i had to put a target on your back and make sure you wouldn 't capitulate to the authorities , but you didn 't .
screw this . _eos ah ... _eos damon , where are you going ? _eos you know what the shortest distance between point " a " and point " b " is , henry ?
do you handle cash in that hotel of yours ? _eos yeah ... _eos sometimes . _eos i suppose you stole some of it ?
she was okay with that . _eos hell , even i could have been okay if you 'd only been just right in the head . _eos you 're lying . _eos all those pills that she took , she couldn 't stand to be around you .
got your message . _eos why are we at your father 's safe house ? _eos 'cause i was notified earlier on that it is now my safe house . _eos what are you talking about ?
i want you out of my office . _eos superior knows it 's not your fault . _eos and you 'll play a role in this ... _eos no , wait !

life lesson , don 't fall in love with the devil , right ? _eos and you 've suffered the most . _eos i can 't change what happened . _eos just let me help you get back to alec .
so he punished them the same way they committed their crimes . _eos if father patterson knew that reuben 's dad was abusing his mom , he sure as hell would hold him accountable as well . _eos reuben , stop . _eos god will forgive you .
because you misunderstood me . _eos i 'm more than happy to buy the wings , like everyone else , with cash . _eos a whole boatload of money . _eos if you truly worship the dollar , then i 'm your ticket to divinity .
you think that i didn 't deserve to know that you had history with him ? _eos you know , you never really talk about your dad 's death . _eos it 's been ... just blocked ... for a really long time . _eos roll all your windows down , randall .
oh , you can 't leave now . _eos you 're gonna miss the best part : _eos the test . _eos let 's try releasing 100 nanobots .
if that 's the way you want to look at it . _eos you got another way to look at it ? _eos and if i decide the nypd will sit this one out ? _eos we 'll proceed without you .
still meeting me in cars , helping me ... _eos it 's hard for me to believe you 're not part of all this . _eos you 're being scapegoated , and i see it with my own eyes . _eos that 's why i 'm helping you .
i said no , but he wouldn 't listen . _eos not until sid came to my rescue . _eos why didn 't you tell me this before ? _eos owen loses his job , and then you reject him .
well , you said i had nothing to worry about . _eos you don 't . _eos there 's no way sara harvey is gonna get in here . _eos are you sure ?
you were ashamed of it , ashamed of him . _eos and he hated you for it . _eos and i mean hated , joan . _eos he wished you were all dead .
i 'll talk to the chief myself if i have to . _eos back off , harris ! _eos whether you like it or not , your murder and our narcotics case are tied together . _eos so you are working it with us .
clearly such talents would be wasted in city life . _eos i have other talents which would not . _eos but you can 't bear the thought of bath . _eos and you can 't bear the thought of marriage .
- can i borrow it ? _eos - no . _eos - what do you mean no ? _eos - gotta buy something .
i thought you were gonna cover for me . _eos i spoke to captain singh . _eos he thinks we 're at a morphology conference up in bludhaven . _eos so if it 's all the same to you ...
now ! _eos go ! _eos let 's go . _eos stop !
let me in ! _eos oh , no . _eos just let us in . _eos i need you all to calm down .
... that should this reach the press , you 'd be open to charges of nepotism , of ignoring procedure in favor of ... _eos they could charge me with protecting a good man from double jeopardy . _eos i 'll take that all day long . _eos you won 't get to frame it .
when they ask you where you were last night , you tell them you were here training . _eos thank you . _eos for everything . _eos you 're gonna throw the whittaker fight .
my mistake was i assumed you wouldn 't stab me in the back . _eos your mistake is that it backfired . _eos this is all personal , isn 't it ? _eos this is about how claire treated you when i was in the hospital .
you shot her ? _eos oh , my god . _eos i had to . _eos that 's not her leg .

warden said he 's been a model prisoner . _eos that 's the only reason they didn 't object to him coming down here . _eos do you really want to back not hearing what he has to say ? _eos telling him how you feel ?
she was a woman who did not scorn wickedness . _eos and it had the effect of creating a son full of goodness . _eos i 've inquired about you . _eos everyone tells me you are a shining example of goodness .

you are a strange man . _eos you have no idea . _eos enough about me , _eos i overheard your father talk about the shogun .
just want to get this over with , huh ? _eos yes , sir . _eos these ... are my two victims . _eos do you recognize either of them ?
are you crashing a wedding ? _eos of course not . _eos i have an invitation . _eos how did you manage that ?
why are you doing what you 're doing ? _eos you got yours , i just want to make sure everybody else gets theirs . _eos it seems like the right thing to do . _eos for you .
that is the worst idea i have ever heard . _eos if i had time to be inventive , do you think i 'd require assistance ? _eos taking father brown hostage won 't hold much sway with the inspector . _eos he 'd probably give the order to shoot through you .
and that made you angry , knowing that she didn 't want to be with you . _eos angry enough ... to kill ? _eos i had nothing to do with her death . _eos might want to get some ice on that .
put the pinkies in the corners . _eos lift them up . _eos pull them down . _eos stick out your tongue .
how much have you got ? _eos $ 1.5 million . _eos tell you what ... _eos give it to me , and i 'll give you 24 hours .
can you see me ? _eos can you hear me ? _eos this is not over . _eos i will find you .
i just ... _eos god . _eos why are doing this to me ? _eos you really want me to stop ?
alex parrish ... _eos she 's trained , armed , and ready to help . _eos and you can reach her ? _eos just tell her to stay safe .
how did i not know about this ? _eos you never asked , i guess . _eos i love a man in uniform . _eos i would like to meet your father .
they 're lucky to have a friend like you . _eos come to the airlock , no weapons , right now . _eos here . _eos what the hell are you doing ?
who are you ? _eos i mean no harm . _eos please . _eos i saw your fire and was hoping to warm myself .
we 've already told an agent in the office that you will be posing as one trainee . _eos this agent knows who you are , but you don 't know who they are . _eos the test is simple ... _eos identify your contact without blowing your cover .
i give you an execution-style makeover , you lay down , close your eyes for a minute , and i take a few shots . _eos i don 't gotta do nothing for free . _eos especially after the police almost ruined my life . _eos so i hear you got a little girl .
i gave you a dose of the original hzn1 vaccine . _eos it counters his bite and frees us from murphy 's control . _eos i 've been taking it too . _eos i need your help .
anyone with access to the internet knows . _eos but don 't make this about what happened to your friends . _eos make this about guaranteeing another day like that doesn 't happen to the people of syria . _eos do the right thing , like you did a year ago today .
and i ain 't here for her , so you can relax . _eos i know what you come for . _eos gonna take about a day to get it together . _eos shut up , duwan .
you 'll pull something . _eos " calm down " ? _eos this is an end-of-the-world type deal . _eos don 't you tell me to calm down .
i know you consider this grunt work , dr. karev . _eos it 's a far cry from the hallowed halls of the surgical floor . _eos i-i didn 't say that . _eos oh , and i 'm sure you 're not used to taking orders from a nurse .
so let me buy some time to find it . _eos hey , jace and clary ... _eos disappeared through a door to god knows where . _eos you said they 're lost forever .
but unlike you , he didn 't make it out . _eos this says your son died of a heart attack . _eos - yes , a heart attack out of nowhere . _eos you think they 're hiding something .
let 's just keep looking around . _eos i 'm sure there 's a logical explanation . _eos maybe someone shot her somewhere and then dumped her here ? _eos well , that theory wouldn 't really work , because you said the door was locked from the inside , right ?
you killed him because he was after his gold . _eos the gold you found . _eos i 'm right , aren 't i ? _eos what has this war done to you ?
you didn 't do it . _eos 'cause you need me to enact the star city gun registry . _eos i mean , that 's what all this is about , right ? _eos you want to punish the city , because we failed to protect your family .
you said no one needs goggles made of prophecy glass to see that principal fairbrother loves his students . _eos how do you know what prophecy glass is ? _eos i ... well , i ... _eos and you said you were cleaning the pool when we fell in , but you weren 't there .
i know you guys took the complaint . _eos they friends of yours ? _eos no , just following up . _eos i 'll let you know if anything breaks .
where is poseidon ? _eos he 'll be dealt with . _eos wait , hang on , hang on , hang on , man . _eos if you get caught ...
i 've got no desire to be shot by your pursuers or drawn into whatever complicated drama has brought you here . _eos so tell us , why shouldn 't we continue this in the safety of a police facility ? _eos please , i told you , i wasn 't followed . _eos you can trust me .
details , abby . _eos you 'll figure it out . _eos you 're a leader . _eos we believe in you .
don 't you remember that ? _eos i tried to stop you from bleeding out . _eos m-maybe i did . _eos i mean , maybe i 'm the reason that you 're still alive .
oh , now you want to get to know me ? _eos right now , it 's my job . _eos how 's he doing , edwards ? _eos why don 't you ... try to play me something ?
thank you so much . _eos just as soon as you say my name . _eos what ? _eos just say my name , you know .
sorry , this is quite embarrassing . _eos i installed some ... _eos i think the official term is spyware ... on it . _eos you 've been snooping on your wife via her laptop ?
but listen ... first ... we 've got to turn this hotel around . _eos 'cause money 's tied up in it , and it 's a ghost town . _eos which brings us here , now . _eos okay , just be prepared ...
you 're really just gonna stand there and watch me ? _eos it 's kind of the point of shadowing . _eos observe , take notes . _eos why exactly are you doing this ?
you just said he planted the same kind of device . _eos and with very good reason . _eos one i 'm not inclined to disclose at the moment . _eos have it your way .
toby , you need to find a way out . _eos if it wasn 't for you , i wouldn 't be in this bloody situation ! _eos i know . _eos look , i can 't change what happened , but you can 't let him do this to you .
bobby told us you have security cameras above the bar . _eos we 're gonna need to see that footage . _eos yeah , we 're also gonna need the cameras out from the hallway , out in front of the bathroom . _eos yeah , yeah , yeah , you can take it all .
it 's gotta be in one of these snitch boxes , right ? _eos it doesn 't matter how many years ago it was . _eos you need command staff approval to access the c.i. files . _eos you have that ?
that 's fun for you ? _eos to try to push me into killing a man ? _eos oh ... _eos i didn 't push you into anything .
ellie what-is-it syndrome ? _eos ehlers-danlos . _eos it 's extremely hard to diagnose , but all your symptoms add up . _eos you did a great job paying attention to what your body needs .
they 'll pay handsomely for just a glimpse of your beauty . _eos do you know , it 's not even really you . _eos just a shadow on a bit of paper . _eos so why go hungry when you have the power to put food on your plate ?
all right . _eos i just need a minute . _eos are you serious ? _eos get out or watch .
is there any way you can fix that ? _eos not without triggering the fail-safe . _eos well , way to go , dr. strangelove . _eos you built a bomb that can 't be stopped .
how 'd you get that atcu target ? _eos was it fed to you ? _eos this has hydra 's fingerprints all over it . _eos don 't you see ?
remember that you 've worked a hell of a lot for this . _eos you 've practiced in the best possible way . _eos you 'll go out there and enjoy . _eos show them what you know .
meaning you don 't have any rights . _eos unless you want to tell me where bizarro is . _eos mmm , not really . _eos but i do have some information you might find interesting .
do you realize the ethical position you 've put me in ? _eos and you , let me guess , you were gonna make a sexual joke about putting me in a position . _eos that 's true , yeah . _eos because everything 's a joke to you .
well , you 'll read this one . _eos what 's it about ? _eos sex , lies , politics , family . _eos i better keep ‭ the coffee coming , then .
look at what you did to this fucking place . _eos i wonder what would 've made you feel you needed to do this . _eos but you do know we were never able to get a warrant to bug it . _eos oh , not having a warrant wouldn 't stop you .
how 'd you lose it ? _eos super bowl accident . _eos you played in the super bowl ? _eos sorry .
i 'm not your anything . _eos i 'm not gonna kick you out . _eos but i am asking you to respect my wishes . _eos can you do that ?
then why didn 't you tell me about this ? _eos and why you back channeling with kamilah ? _eos i wanted to come to you with airtight evidence . _eos you 're investigating the daughter
oh , it will be . _eos well , that 's not your typical nighttime suit . _eos well , you 're the reason i 'm wearing it . _eos inspiring me to save the city in the light of day .
i 've made some additional adjustments according to the theory of quantum-retro causality , and if my math is correct , the trip through the time stream should reverse your condition . _eos no . _eos no . _eos i 'm not leaving you or the team .
she needs to be with people right now . _eos she needs sleep . _eos or you just don 't want us to see her . _eos you 're scared that we might find out what actually happened .

it 's about caleb ? _eos i threw him out last year when he started calling himself the widowmaker . _eos so whatever he 's done , you 're gonna have to go ask whoever it is he 's making miserable now . _eos is this the , uh , sink that 's giving you trouble ?
republican intransigence resulted in a good man 's death , but you fought for him . _eos it 's a theme for a presidential run . _eos republican brinksmanship versus a good man who wants to get things done . _eos where you going ?
you 've been so many places . _eos it 's like you 've had three lives . _eos me , i 've never left harmony falls . _eos that 's your first mistake .
if they tell you i committed suicide , it 's a lie . _eos they 'll show you proof . _eos maybe even a letter written by me . _eos don 't believe it .
and it 's your place to judge ? _eos a commitment-phobe suddenly committing to two people ? _eos uh , yeah ! _eos your problem wasn 't that he was with two people ...
where are you going ? _eos i 'm going to find livewire and her soldiers because someone has to . _eos and apparently i 'm the only person in national city that appreciates how evil she actually is . _eos - well , let me come with you .
i know about the new york cop you 're using as an informant . _eos - what the hell were you thinking ? _eos - he 's looking for his runaway daughter . _eos i 've never known you to give a damn about anything if it didn 't relate to a case you 're working on .

in a world both frightening and unlucky , there are a few comforts . _eos one of them is making new friends . _eos friends can make you feel the world is smaller and safer than it really is , because you know people who have similar experiences . _eos when you meet people like that , you may find your world feels a little more complete .
and trying to be a good person . _eos you think so ? _eos you think she 's going to be your friend ? _eos let me tell you something .
do you think that fact somehow absolves you from your past crimes ? _eos no . _eos although i 'm sure there are others who do remember and would love to remind me . _eos your propensity for violence is remarkable .

- yes ! _eos - the daughter you ran out on . _eos you left her motherless ! _eos and you put me in prison .
you don 't . _eos this is a world of one-way mirrors , emma . _eos all you 're doing is giving me a headache . _eos oh , stop being so melodramatic .
